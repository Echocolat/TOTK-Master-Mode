It is __recommended to start a whole new save__ with this mod for the best experience possible!\r\n\r\n#### Features\r\n- This mod comes with [True Damage Display v2](https://gamebanana.com/mods/568686) integrated in it. It makes it so that the game actually displays how it changes fuse damage on spears and two handed weapons, and also makes sure that other attack modifiers are also affected by the weapon type.\r\n- All scalable enemies (Bokoblins, Moblins, Lizalfos, Horriblins, Boss Bokoblins, Lynels, Soldier Constructs and Captain Constructs) __were scaled by one rank__. For example, all red Bokoblins are blue in the mod. At least one specimen of each base enemy will stay, for Hyrule Compendium, Quests or Armor upgrades.\r\n- All scalable enemies now have a new rank (Golden for all Monsters, Seized for the Constructs), __stronger__, tankier, faster, but also __more rewarding__ with their unique fusable materials and better overall drops. \r\n- All mini bosses (Molduga, Gleeok, Frox, Flux Construct, Hinox and Talus) now have a new, __unique__ more powerful rank, wielding unique fuse materials. You can learn more about them in the __Challenge Mode - Rumors__ book in the Room of Awakening. Doing so will also start new quests that will guide you through the discovery of the rest of the exclusive content of the mod.\r\n- New weapons were added, or readded! __Lynel weapons__ are back. You can also get the standalone version of Lynel weapons [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/494687), thanks to Godzilaa4 for making the mod! Zonaite weapons also got a __new rank__ of weapons in order to make them more interesting in mid and late game.\r\n- A wide array of map changes were made to the surface, mostly to add more __Lynels__ to the map and make the enemy camps more diversified. __No more Bokoblin only camps__! As of 1.1.0 version of the mod and onward, the Depths were also changed for the same reasons, also adding some powerful modified weapons at specific places. As of 1.2.0 version of the mod and onward, this change is also applied to even more of the Surface, Sky and Dungeons.\r\n- As a development to the previous change, the six __Monster Camps__ involved in the Monster Control Crew quests have been severely buffed, making a hard late game challenge. They were given __new, powerful and unique reward__ for three of them, so don\u0027t forget to check them out!\r\n\r\n#### Options\r\n\r\nThis mod comes with multiple options that when all activated represent what we envisioned when creating it, but that we are aware won\u0027t please everybody, that is why they are options.\r\n**Currently, TKMM doesn\u0027t work properly with bigger mods, so please do NOT install the mod with TKMM. This will be updated once TKMM is fixed, with a .tkcl file where you will be able to select your options. For now, recommended build downloads include all recommended options.**\r\n\r\n##### Additions\r\n- **All bosses buff**: Bosses are all stronger and faster (except for Ganondorf), Dungeon bosses deal gloom damage. (__recommended__)\r\n- **Bl\u00E5haj over Blue Sand Seal Plush**: Replaces the Blue Sand Seal Plushes with Bl\u00E5hajs. Trans rights are human rights :) (this is just a port of [the eponymous mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/499961))\r\n- **Brazilian over American English**: Playing with the American English language will instead use the brazilian translation made by the [Triforce Heroes Team](https://triforce-heroes.com.br/) (for the vanilla game) and Godzilaa4 (for the Challenge Mode part).\r\n- **Challenge Mode enemies are faster**: All enemies introduced in Challenge Mode are faster than their previous counterparts. (__recommended__)\r\n- **Demon King Ganondorf buff**: Ganondorf is stronger, tankier and faster, his phase 1 projectiles delete your heart containers like in phase 2. (__recommended__)\r\n- **True Demon King\u0027s Army**: Custom Demon King\u0027s Army made more interesting and way harder. (__recommended__)\r\n\r\n##### Buffs\r\n- **Better Defense Up meal effect**: The Defense Up meal effect is buffed in order to make it viable and interesting against Attack Up. Level 1 goes from 4 to 12, Level 2 goes from 12 to 24 and Level 3 goes from 24 to 48. (__recommended__)\r\n\r\n##### Nerfs\r\n- **Higher Gloom damage multiplier**: Gloomed enemies in the vanilla game inflict 0.3x times their damage converted to gloomed hearts. This was changed to 0.8x their damage. (__recommended__)\r\n- **Hitstun nerf for Link**: Most of Link\u0027s attacks do not interrupt enemies\u0027 actions. (__recommended__)\r\n- **Nerfed charge attacks**: Link\u0027s charged attacks take more time to charge and take more stamina. Two handed weapon charge attack does less damage. (__recommended__)\r\n- **Nerfed Flurry Rush**: Link\u0027s Flurry Rushes inflict less hits. (__recommended__)\r\n- **No natural Gloomed hearts regeneration**: Gloomed hearts no longer regenerate on the Surface or under lightroots. This is heavily recommended because some new enemies will have your heart UI glitched without this option. (__recommended__)\r\n- **No One Shot Protection**: Disables one shot protection. (__recommended__)\r\n- **No saving during battle**: Disables saving when you fight. (__recommended__)\r\n- **Oblivious sages**: Sages don\u0027t attack enemies, enemies aren\u0027t distracted by Sages. (__recommended__)\r\n\r\n##### Rebalances\r\n- **Rebalanced Armor upgrade cost**: Armor upgrades that need scalable enemy parts will require the level above, to take into account the Challenge Mode scaling. (__recommended__)\r\n- **Rebalanced Cooking**: It\u0027s impossible for the player to eat raw materials, and cooked food (e.g. Boiled Egg, Frozen and Roasted food) is no longer able to stack. Non Zonai scalable enemy parts were buffed, or heavily buffed compared to vanilla, so that they still offer some value even compared to the new, very powerful golden enemy parts. The amount of meal slots was divided by 2 (60 -\u003E 30). (__recommended__)\r\n- **Rebalanced modifiers**: Each weapon, bow and shield has now its unique ranges of modifier values. (__recommended__)\r\n\r\n##### Masochism options\r\n- **All enemies scale**: Very unrecommended option unless you want to suffer. This makes it so that all map enemies scale automatically if possible, regardless of their map parameters. Basically, all camps will be full golden in NG\u002B, and will become full golden at some point after playing in non NG\u002B.\r\n- **Dangerous Bokoblin Baskets**: Elemental fruits thrown by Bokoblins from their baskets have the area of effect of associated elemental gems.\r\n- **Demon King Ganondorf buff\u002B**: Demon King Ganondorf buff but on steroids. Demon King Ganondorf is even tankier and stronger, and now deletes your heart containers with ALL of his attacks. He puts all shields at one durability in one attack and all non-Master Sword weapons that hit him will break in one hit.\r\n- **Enemy Health Regeneration**: Most of the enemies regenerate slowly their health on a %age basis after 5 seconds untouched, until they regenerated 100% of their health. Made by MaxLastBreath.\r\n- **Hardcore Floating Coliseum**: Very unrecommended option unless you want to suffer. This makes the Floating Coliseum way harder than it is in the base mod.\r\n- **True Demon King\u0027s Army\u002B**: True Demon King\u0027s Army but on steroids. Very painful, and absolutely not balanced. WARNING: This may crash your Nintendo Switch hardware.\r\n- **Unnerfed New Gleeok**: The new Gleeok is at its prime state, before the wave of nerfs she received. Not balanced.\r\n\r\n### Regarding save files\r\n\r\nALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILES BEFORE ENABLING OR DISABLING THE MOD. Saving the game with the mod disabled will not get rid of the new materials, weapons, armors etc. Challenge Mode adds from your save file, but as long as the mod is disabled said objects will not be able to be interacted with in your inventory, and trying to do anything with them may result in a freeze or a softlock. Saving with the mod disabled will also remove all the new Challenge Mode flags which means that any new enemy, chest, or weapon spawn will respawn for the next time you will play the mod on this save file, which can alter the player\u0027s experience. If you start a save file with Challenge Mode, it\u0027s better to not play said save file when Challenge Mode is disabled.\r\n\r\n### Known issues (v1.2.7)\r\n- New spears introduced by the mod drop further from the player when dropped from the inventory, and their visual swing effect when fused is located way lower on the handle (No fix for the moment)\r\n- Enemy Health Regeneration sometimes makes it so that enemies start with only a small portion of their HP. This is being worked on.\r\n\r\n### If you encounter another issue\r\nPlease report the issue in the #bug-report channel of the Discord server, detailling your game version, platform, issue and if possible with a crash log. We will try to help you and fix the issue if it has to be fixed the quickest possible.
