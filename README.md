## TOTK Challenge Mode (v1.2.0)

### Mod description

This mod aims to make Tears of the Kingdom __harder__ by adding new, __more dangerous enemies__ and __tweaking game mechanics__ for a more challenging and interesting experience with the game. It is __recommended to start a whole new save__ with this mod for the best experience possible!

#### Features
- This mod comes with [True Damage Display v2](https://gamebanana.com/mods/568686) integrated in it. It makes it so that the game actually displays how it changes fuse damage on spears and two handed weapons, and also makes sure that other attack modifiers are also affected by the weapon type.
- All scalable enemies (Bokoblins, Moblins, Lizalfos, Horriblins, Boss Bokoblins, Lynels, Soldier Constructs and Captain Constructs) __were scaled by one rank__. For example, all red Bokoblins are blue in the mod. At least one specimen of each base enemy will stay, for Hyrule Compendium, Quests or Armor upgrades.
- All scalable enemies now have a new rank (Golden for all Monsters, Seized for the Constructs), __stronger__, tankier, faster, but also __more rewarding__ with their unique fusable materials and better overall drops. 
- All mini bosses (Molduga, Gleeok, Frox, Flux Construct, Hinox and Talus) now have a new, __unique__ more powerful rank, wielding unique fuse materials. You can learn more about them in the __Challenge Mode - Rumors__ book in the Room of Awakening.
- New weapons were added, or readded! __Lynel weapons__ are back. You can also get the standalone version of Lynel weapons [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/494687), thanks to Godzilaa4 for making the mod! Zonaite weapons also got a __new rank__ of weapons in order to make them more interesting in mid and late game.
- A wide array of map changes were made to the surface, mostly to add more __Lynels__ to the map and make the enemy camps more diversified. __No more Bokoblin only camps__! As of 1.1.0 version of the mod and onward, the Depths were also changed for the same reasons, also adding some powerful modified weapons at specific places. As of 1.2.0 version of the mod and onward, this change is also applied to even more of the Surface, Sky and Dungeons.
- As a development to the previous change, the six __Monster Camps__ involved in the Monster Control Crew quests have been severely buffed, making a hard late game challenge. They were given __new, powerful and unique reward__ for three of them, so don't forget to check them out!

#### Options

This mod comes with multiple options that when all activated represent what we envisioned when creating it, but that we are aware won't please everybody, that is why they are options.
**Currently, TKMM doesn't work properly with bigger mods, so please do NOT install the mod with TKMM. This will be updated once TKMM is fixed, with a .tkcl file where you will be able to select your options. For now, recommended build downloads include all recommended options.**

##### Additions
- **All bosses buff**: Bosses are all stronger and faster, Dungeon bosses deal gloom damage. (__recommended__)
- **Blåhaj over Blue Sand Seal Plush**: Replaces the Blue Sand Seal Plushes with Blåhajs. Trans rights are human rights :) (this is just a port of [the eponymous mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/499961))
- **Brazilian over American English**: Playing with the American English language will instead use the brazilian translation made by the [Triforce Heroes Team](https://triforce-heroes.com.br/) (for the vanilla game) and Godzilaa4 (for the Challenge Mode part).
- **Challenge Mode enemies are faster**: All enemies introduced in Challenge Mode are faster than their previous counterparts. (__recommended__)
- **True Demon King's Army**: Custom Demon King's Army made more interesting and way harder. (__recommended__)

##### Buffs
- **Better Defense Up meal effect**: The Defense Up meal effect is buffed in order to make it viable and interesting against Attack Up. Level 1 goes from 4 to 12, Level 2 goes from 12 to 24 and Level 3 goes from 24 to 48. (__recommended__)

##### Nerfs
- **Higher Gloom damage multiplier**: Gloomed enemies in the vanilla game inflict 0.3x times their damage converted to gloomed hearts. This was changed to 0.8x their damage. (__recommended__)
- **Hitstun nerf for Link**: Most of Link's attacks do not interrupt enemies' actions. (__recommended__)
- **Nerfed charge attacks**: Link's charged attacks take more time to charge and take more stamina. Two handed weapon charge attack does less damage. (__recommended__)
- **Nerfed Flurry Rush**: Link's Flurry Rushes inflict less hits. (__recommended__)
- **No natural Gloomed hearts regeneration**: Gloomed hearts no longer regenerate on the Surface or under lightroots. This is heavily recommended because some new enemies will have your heart UI glitched without this option. (__recommended__)
- **No One Shot Protection**: Disables one shot protection. (__recommended__)
- **Oblivious sages**: Sages don't attack enemies, enemies aren't distracted by Sages. (__recommended__)

##### Rebalances
- **Rebalanced Armor upgrade cost**: Armor upgrades that need scalable enemy parts will require the level above, to take into account the Challenge Mode scaling. (__recommended__)
- **Rebalanced Cooking**: It's impossible for the player to eat raw materials, and cooked food (e.g. Boiled Egg, Frozen and Roasted food) is no longer able to stack. Non Zonai scalable enemy parts were buffed, or heavily buffed compared to vanilla, so that they still offer some value even compared to the new, very powerful golden enemy parts. The amount of meal slots was divided by 2 (60 -> 30). (__recommended__)
- **Rebalanced modifiers**: Each weapon, bow and shield has now its unique ranges of modifier values. (__recommended__)

##### Masochism options
- **All enemies scale**: Very unrecommended option unless you want to suffer. This makes it so that all map enemies scale automatically if possible, regardless of their map parameters. Basically, all camps will be full golden in NG+, and will become full golden at some point after playing in non NG+.
- **Dangerous Bokoblin Baskets**: Elemental fruits thrown by Bokoblins from their baskets have the area of effect of associated elemental gems.
- **Enemy Health Regeneration**: Most of the enemies regenerate slowly their health on a %age basis after 5 seconds untouched, until they regenerated 100% of their health. Made by MaxLastBreath.
- **Hardcore Floating Coliseum**: Very unrecommended option unless you want to suffer. This makes the Floating Coliseum way harder than it is in the base mod.
- **True Demon King's Army+**: True Demon King's Army but on steroids. Very painful, and absolutely not balanced.
- **Unnerfed New Gleeok**: The new Gleeok is at its prime state, before the wave of nerfs she received. Not balanced.

### How to install

First of all, make sure you are not using other mods at the same time (except for Performance mods like [Ultracam](https://gamebanana.com/mods/480138), and mods that do not edit any of the system files).
Also make sure that you are not playing on version 1.0.0 of the game, which is not supported.

##### On Yuzu (and forks)
- Download the version of the mod that matches what you're using. (e.g. if you want the recommended build and you're playing on version 1.2.0 of the game, download `challenge_mode_XXX_for_v120_recommended_.zip`).
- In Yuzu, right click on the game and click Open mod folder.
- Extract the .zip file inside the mod folder.
- Right click the game again and click Properties, to check if the mod is properly enabled.

##### On Ryujinx (and forks)
- Download the version of the mod that matches what you're using. (e.g. if you want the recommended build and you're playing on version 1.2.0 of the game, download `challenge_mode_XXX_for_v120_recommended_.zip`).
- In Ryujinx, right click on the game and click Open mod data location.
- Extract the .zip file inside the mod folder.
- Right click the game again and click Manage Mods, to check if the mod is properly enabled.

##### On Switch hardware (atmosphere)
- Download the version of the mod that matches what you're using. (e.g. if you want the recommended build and you're playing on version 1.2.0 of the game, download `challenge_mode_XXX_for_v120_recommended_.zip`).
- In your modded Switch SD Card, navigate to `atmosphere\contents\0100F2C0115B6000` and extract the `romfs` and `exefs` folders from the mod archive in it.
- In your modded Switch SD Card, navigate to `atmosphere\contents\0100F2C0115B6000\exefs`, locate the IPS file inside, and cut paste it in `atmosphere\exefs_patches\Challenge Mode`. If that folder doesn't exist, create it.

### Regarding save files

ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILES BEFORE ENABLING OR DISABLING THE MOD. Saving the game with the mod disabled will not get rid of the new materials, weapons, armors etc. Challenge Mode adds from your save file, but as long as the mod is disabled said objects will not be able to be interacted with in your inventory, and trying to do anything with them may result in a freeze or a softlock. Saving with the mod disabled will also remove all the new Challenge Mode flags which means that any new enemy, chest, or weapon spawn will respawn for the next time you will play the mod on this save file, which can alter the player's experience. If you start a save file with Challenge Mode, it's better to not play said save file when Challenge Mode is disabled.

### Known issues (v1.2.0)
- New spears introduced by the mod drop further from the player when dropped from the inventory, and their visual swing effect when fused is located way lower on the handle (No fix for the moment)

### If you encounter another issue
Please report the issue in the `#bug-report channel` of the Discord server, detailling your game version, platform, issue and if possible with a crash log. We will try to help you and fix the issue if it has to be fixed the quickest possible. Thanks!
