### Master Mode project attempt for Tears of the Kingdom (works only on 1.1.0)

##### Regular gameplay changes

- Elemental objects in Bokoblin baskets are replaced with elemental ores
- [True Damage Display](https://gamebanana.com/mods/478039) is implemented

##### Regular gameplay changes with the Gameplay changes version
- Gloom damage went from 0.3x damage to 0.8x damage
- Almost all Link's attacks do not interrupt enemies' actions
- Charged attacks are slower and take more stamina
- Hitting a Lynel when on its back does less damage for one handed and two handed weapons
- Flurry rush deals less hits than vanilla
- Spin to win only does 0.5x damage
- Can't eat raw materials. Can only have one of each cooked material

##### Scaling
- All enemies that have golden variants (so not counting Constructs) will go up a rank (like in BotW). There will still be one of each base enemy for the compendium. Each tier of enemy will use the XP threshold of the previous rank, like in BotW as well. e.g. Silver Lizalfos -> Golden Lizalfos will occur when Black Lizalfos -> Silver Lizalfos would have occured in Normal Mode.
