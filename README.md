### Master Mode project attempt for Tears of the Kingdom

##### Regular gameplay changes
- Gloom damage went from 0.3x damage to 0.8x damage
- Link's combo starters and jumped attacks (except for 2H) don't ragdoll enemies
- Charged attacks are slower and take more stamina
- Hitting a Lynel when on its back does less damage for one handed and two handed weapons

##### Scaling
- All enemies that have golden variants will go up a rank (like in BotW). There will still be one of each base enemy for the compendium.
