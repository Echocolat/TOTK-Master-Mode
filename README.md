> #### Version Support: (1.1.0)

## Regular Gameplay Changes

- Implements the [True Damage Display](https://gamebanana.com/mods/478039) mod.

## Enhanced Gameplay Changes (Gameplay Changes Version)

- Gloom damage increased from `0.3x` to `0.8x`.  
- Link's attacks generally *do not* interrupt enemy actions.  
- Charged attacks are *slower* and consume *more stamina*.  
- Attacks on a Lynel's back deal *reduced* damage with one-handed and two-handed weapons.  
- Flurry rush executes *fewer* hits compared to the vanilla version.  
- The "*Spin to Win*" move now inflicts only `0.5x` damage.  
- Consumption of raw materials is *disabled*. Players can only have **one** of each cooked material at a time.

## Enemy Scaling

All enemies with golden variants will advance one rank higher. 

Following the same XP threshold progression as in Breath of the Wild, each enemy type will scale up one level (e.g., Silver Lizalfos to Golden Lizalfos will occur at the same point Black Lizalfos to Silver Lizalfos would in Normal Mode). There will be one of each base enemy type preserved for the compendium.
