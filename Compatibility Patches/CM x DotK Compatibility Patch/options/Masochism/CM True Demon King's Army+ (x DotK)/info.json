Very painful, and absolutely not balanced. No temporary save is made after beating it, which will make you restart the Army if you lose to Demon King Ganondorf. Includes some Depths of the Kingdom enemies. DO NOT USE WITH ANY OTHER ARMY OPTION. WARNING: This may crash your Nintendo Switch hardware.","Thumbnail":null}
