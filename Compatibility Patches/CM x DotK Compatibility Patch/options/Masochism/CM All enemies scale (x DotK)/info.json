{"Priority":5,"Id":"01JNF29ARKWTK8SGRQCV7ZC3NY","Name":"CM All enemies scale (x DotK)","Description":"Very unrecommended option unless you want to suffer. This makes it so that all map enemies scale automatically if possible, as well as their weapons. This is ONLY applied to Depths of the Kingdom\u0027s new spawns. For the full scale of the option you have to also enable the All enemies scale option in the Challenge Mode normal installation.","Thumbnail":null}
