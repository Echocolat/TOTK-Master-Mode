{"Contributors":[{"Author":"Echocolat","Contribution":"Lead developer of Challenge Mode"},{"Author":"PotatoFried17","Contribution":"Lead developer of Depths of the Kingdom"}],"Dependencies":[],"Version":"1.3.4 x 1.0.2","Author":"Echocolat","Id":"01JNF29ARJA4HS8BRHZ85T2GED","Name":"Challenge Mode x Depths of the Kingdom Compatibility Patch","Description":"## Challenge Mode x Depths of the Kingdom Compatibility Patch\r\n\r\n### Mod description\r\n\r\nThis is a compatibility patch between [Challenge Mode](https://gamebanana.com/mods/537404) and [Depths of the Knigdom](https://gamebanana.com/mods/578624), targeted at versions 1.3.4 and 1.0.2 respectively.\r\n\r\nIt aims to properly implement and balance Depths of the Kingdom\u0027s amazing changes and new enemies, weapons, armors etc. to the deadly Depths of Challenge Mode.\r\n\r\n#### Options\r\n\r\nThis compatibility patch comes with four options that complement Challenge Mode\u0027s in order to add Depths of the Kingdom\u0027s new content properly in them.\r\n\r\n##### Additions\r\n- **CM True Demon King\u0027s Army (x DotK)**: Custom Demon King\u0027s Army made more interesting and way harder. Includes some Depths of the Kingdom enemies. (__recommended__)\r\n\r\n##### Rebalances\r\n- **CM Rebalanced modifiers (x DotK)**: Each weapon, bow and shield has now its unique ranges of modifier values. This is ONLY applied to Depths of the Kingdom\u0027s new content. For the full scale of this option, you have to also enable the Rebalanced modifiers option in the Challenge Mode normal installation. (__recommended__)\r\n\r\n##### Masochism\r\n- **CM All enemies scale (x DotK)**: Very unrecommended option unless you want to suffer. This makes it so that all map enemies scale automatically if possible, as well as their weapons. This is ONLY applied to Depths of the Kingdom\u0027s new spawns. For the full scale of the option you have to also enable the All enemies scale option in the Challenge Mode normal installation.\r\n- **CM True Demon King\u0027s Army\u002B (x DotK)**: True Demon King\u0027s Army but on steroids. Very painful, and absolutely not balanced. No temporary save is made after beating it, which will make you restart the Army if you lose to Demon King Ganondorf.  Includes some Depths of the Kingdom enemies. WARNING: This may crash your Nintendo Switch hardware. \r\n\r\n### How to install\r\n\r\nDepths of the Kingdom is only available on version 1.2.1 at the moment, so the only way to play this compatiblity patch is also with version 1.2.1, even though the compatibility patch is technically cross platform.\r\n*Note*: Since Depths of the Kingdom is only available in english, french and spanish at the moment, only those three languages are supported.\r\n\r\nInstall [Challenge Mode\u0027s TCKL](https://github.com/Echocolat/TOTK-Master-Mode/blob/main/Packaged/Challenge%20Mode%201.3.4.tkcl?raw=true).\r\nInstall [Depths of the Kingdom](https://gamebanana.com/mods/578624).\r\nInstall this compatibliity patch.\r\n\r\n**The priority order should be**:\r\n- Challenge Mode x Depths of the Kingdom Compatibility Patch (TOP)\r\n- Depths of the Kingdom\r\n- Challenge Mode (BOTTOM)\r\n\r\n### Regarding save files\r\n\r\nALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILES BEFORE ENABLING OR DISABLING THE MOD. Saving the game with the mod disabled will not get rid of the new materials, weapons, armors etc. Challenge Mode adds from your save file, but as long as the mod is disabled said objects will not be able to be interacted with in your inventory, and trying to do anything with them may result in a freeze or a softlock. Saving with the mod disabled will also remove all the new Challenge Mode flags which means that any new enemy, chest, or weapon spawn will respawn for the next time you will play the mod on this save file, which can alter the player\u0027s experience. If you start a save file with Challenge Mode, it\u0027s better to not play said save file when Challenge Mode is disabled.\r\n\r\n### Known issues (CM v1.3.4)\r\n- New spears introduced by the mod drop further from the player when dropped from the inventory, and their visual swing effect when fused is located way lower on the handle (No fix for the moment)\r\n- Enemy Health Regeneration sometimes makes it so that enemies start with only a small portion of their HP. This is being worked on.\r\n- When installed through TKMM, the credits are a bit messed up. This should be fixed in TKMM\u0027s next update.\r\n\r\n### Known issues (DotK v1.0.2)\r\n- None\r\n\r\n### If you encounter another issue\r\nPlease report the issue in the \u0060#bug-report channel\u0060 of the Challenge Mode Discord server, detailling your game version, platform, issue and if possible with a crash log. We will try to help you and fix the issue if it has to be fixed the quickest possible.
